##### Introduction 

There are two files(dataset) given by DPDzero - Leading firms in analysis.
First file is portfolio_data which contains data about loans given. It has loan number , due date, state to which the person belongs , dateofbirth of a person to whom the loan has been granted and the loan amount granted.


Second file is CommunicationHistory which contains the details about 'contacting information to a a customer' for example it contains data like loan number , campaign id in which he was contatcted , call time of a customer and status whether completed or not.


I have shared the link of my Google sheet where Full Analysis of data is done and have uploaded the report of it also.
